## Genetic Algorithm

Genetic Algorithm(GA) is a kind of method learned from animal evolution. It generates the latter hypothesis by mutation and crossover (we call the two as `operator`).

In GA, we search the candidate hypothesis space to find the best hypothesis. 

The best hypothesis has the best `fitness`, which is the digital metric of current problem.
