## Concept Learning

Defination: From a lot of Input and Output training examples about a Boolean Function to infer this Boolean Function

#### Inductive Learning Hypothesis

If any hypothesis can approximate the target function in enough training examples, it can approximate the target function greatly in instances.

## Algorithms

- Find-S (Find the maximum special hypothesis)
- Candidate Elimination
