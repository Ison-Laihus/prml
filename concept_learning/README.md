## Concept Learning

Defination: From a lot of Input and Output training examples about a Boolean Function to infer this Boolean Function

#### Inductive Learning Hypothesis

If any hypothesis can approximate the target function in enough training examples, it can approximate the target function greatly in instances.

## Algorithms

- Find-S (Find the maximum special hypothesis)
    - has some disadvantages
        - whether converge to the right target concept in learning process or not
        - why using the most special hypothesis
        - does the training examples are consistent
        - what would we do if we have more than one maximum special hypothesis
- List-Then-Elimination
    - advantage
        - solve the problems of `Find-S`
    - disadvantage
        - need list all hypothesis which is cumbersome
- Candidate Elimination
    - advantage
        - solve the problem of `List-Then-Elimination`
