## Decision Tree Learning

`Decision Tree Learning` is the most widely used `Inductive Infer Algorithms`.

`Decision Tree Learning` is a method of approximating discrete target function, in which the learned funciton is represented as a `Decision Tree`.

The learned `Decision Tree` can also be represented as multiple rules of `If-Then`.

This Learning Algorith is the most popular `Inductive Infer Algorithm`.

As usual, a `Decision Tree` represents the conjunction and disjunction of the attribute values constraints of instance.
